## About

This repository tracks recent research papers in autonomous driving, covering topics including:
- Perception (object detection, segmentation, tracking)
- Planning and decision-making
- Control systems
- Prediction and forecasting
- Simulation environments
- End-to-end learning approaches
- Mapping and localization
- Safety and verification
- Datasets and benchmarks

Papers are automatically fetched from arXiv and categorized by topic for easy navigation.

## 🤖 How It Works

This repository uses automation to stay up-to-date with the latest research:

- **Automated Fetching**: Python script queries the arXiv API daily using relevant keywords
- **Smart Categorization**: Papers are categorized by topic using keyword analysis
- **Auto-Generated README**: This README is automatically generated with formatted paper information
- **GitHub Actions**: Updates run automatically every day at 00:00 UTC

## ⚙️ Local Usage

Want to run the scraper locally or contribute to the project?

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/qinjing/AlphaAD.git
cd AlphaAD

# The script uses only Python standard library (no external dependencies)
python3 scrape_arxiv.py
```

**Requirements**: Python 3.11 or higher

## 🤝 Contributing
